1. Initially, I undertook the development of a Dama game using the Python programming language, meticulously implementing all the necessary rules and functionalities.

2. Subsequently, I embarked on creating an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of playing the game autonomously. Employing the minimax algorithm as the foundation, I further refined the AI by integrating optimization techniques such as alpha-beta pruning, memoization, and bitwise operations, all implemented in Python.

3. Recognizing the importance of computational efficiency, I made the decision to optimize the AI engine by refactoring its entire codebase into C++. Capitalizing on the inherent speed advantages offered by C++, the AI engine demonstrated significant performance enhancements. It could now evaluate up to 1 million moves within a remarkably brief timeframe of less than 5 seconds, reaching tree depths as deep as 14. These improvements resulted in the AI outperforming top-level players in the game.

4. Building upon the achievements thus far, I shifted my focus to establishing an online multiplayer environment along with a matchmaking system. Employing a client-server architecture, developed in Python utilizing sockets, players were afforded the opportunity to engage in challenging online matches against one another.

5. Presently, I am actively engaged in developing a comprehensive website that incorporates all previously mentioned features, in addition to introducing supplementary elements such as player ratings, puzzle challenges, instructional courses, and more.
