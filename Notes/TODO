Large:
1. multithread it (CPU or GPU)
2. more pruning
3. better eval function (maybe reinforcment learning)
4. better akel generation (eat_max, etc etc)
5. ✔ organize code into files and Classes and functions


Medium:
1. Fix leaks
2. consider teskeer l kash early in the moves.
2. undo
3. improve check_for_force performance by creating a get_max_akel_length function
4. ✔ minimax can only return eval, and at the end get the best move based on the evals of level 1

Small:
1. ✔ There is a bug in sombol logic, sometimes its playing fumb moves, fix it.
