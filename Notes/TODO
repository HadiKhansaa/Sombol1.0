Large:
1. multithread it (CPU or GPU)
2. more pruning
3. better eval function (maybe reinforcment learning)
4. better akel generation (eat_max, etc etc)
5. ✔ organize code into files and Classes and functions


Medium:
1. ✔ Fix leaks
2. ✔ consider teskeer l kash early in the moves.
2. undo
4. ✔ minimax can only return eval, and at the end get the best move based on the evals of level 1

Small:
1. ✔ let minimax start with an array of valid moves rather than playing everyone of them
2. 3mal concept l zewye l aweye wl zewye l d3ife, its really important for endgames

Bugs:
1. very weird behaviour: its doing some terrible moves withoug orderMoves + its playing somewhat weirdly now even with it ma 3ende fekra sho l sabab.
